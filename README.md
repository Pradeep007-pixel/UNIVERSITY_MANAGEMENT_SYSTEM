# UNIVERSITY_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM
 This project, "University Management System in Java Swing," aims to develop a comprehensive management tool for universities to handle academic and administrative activities. Using Java Swing, we created an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate interactions for students, faculty, and administrators.
